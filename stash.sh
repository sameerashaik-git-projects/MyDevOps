When we do the stash to the newly created files in working area..Those files aare not included in stash
Now we will add the files from staging area and after the commit and lets see if the files are included in the stash
from staging are the new file is included in the stash
Now lets try with the file after the commit..
After commiting file as there are nothing to commit...it wont be included to the stash


SO ONLY FILES THAT ARE MODIFIED AFTER COMMITING AND THE FILES IN STAGING AREA ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN STASH.The file that is included in the stash from st6aging area is lost..


SO WE HAVE TO APPLY STASH ON ALREADY PUSHED FILES OR MODIFIED FILES DTS IT
